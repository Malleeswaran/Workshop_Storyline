Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, there was a potato named Spud who dreamed of becoming a French fry.
So, he enrolled in a cooking class for vegetables.
But alas, every time he tried to fry himself, he just ended up a little crispy on the edges and still quite potato-y in the middle.
In the end, Spud embraced his potato-ness and opened a successful mashed potato restaurant, where he laughed at his own crispy misadventures.
The end.
There was another potato named Spub who dreamed of being a mashed potato.
He also enrolled in a cooking class and he was eaten by his classmates.
